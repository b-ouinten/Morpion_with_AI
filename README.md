This is a morpion AI-based. The AI was implemented using the concept of trees in algorithms.

#### There are five levels of difficulty :
- level 1 : random
- level 2 : tree depth = 1 
- level 3 : tree depth = 3 
- level 4 : tree depth = 5 
- ultimate : tree depth = as deep as possible

##### A undo-redo system was also implemented.

#### Technologies :
- JavaScript
- OOP
- Trees
